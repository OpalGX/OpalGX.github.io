I will be starting a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in 2023. Before this, I received PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Edinburgh, supported by the MAC-MIGS CDT programme. My research interests include learning on graphs/hypergraphs such as embedding, clustering and structure recovery, generative models that describe the interaction mechanism, and dynamics process on graphs/hypergraphs. I am also interested in the application of graph/hypergraph-based approaches to real-world problems such as social networks analysis, image classification, and natural language processing.  My current research involves analysing graphs/hypergraph embedding algorithms and deriving corresponding random graph models.

Before my PhD, I earned an MSc in Statistics from the National University of Singapore, and a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore during which I developed my interest in understanding interactions and patterns in complex systems.
