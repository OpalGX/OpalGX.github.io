I will be starting a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in 2023. Before this, I received PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Edinburgh, supported by the  [MAC-MIGS CDT](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) programme. My research interests include learning on graphs/hypergraphs such as embedding, clustering and structure recovery, generative models that describe the interaction mechanism, and dynamics process on graphs/hypergraphs. I am also interested in the application of graph/hypergraph-based approaches to real-world problems such as social networks analysis, image classification, and natural language processing.  My current research involves analysing graphs/hypergraph embedding algorithms and deriving corresponding random graph models.

Before my PhD, I earned an MSc in Statistics from the National University of Singapore, and a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore during which I developed my interest in understanding interactions and patterns in complex systems.

## Current research interests##
I am interested in graph embedding/graph drawing algorithms that find the position of nodes to reveal certain structures, and understanding what generative model they are assuming. These models take the node position as input, and generate edges randomly.  These model have several potential benefits: they help us quantify structures and answering the question such as "why we should draw the graph this way rather than another?" They also provide a model to generate synthetic data the produce desired structures. They also help interpret the graph embedding, for example if we know the position of two nodes, we could learn the probability distribution of the edge between them using the model.
