## Generative hypergraph models and spectral embedding ##
Published in Scientic Report, 2023 [journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27565-9) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13895)

We consider the problem of embedding a hypergraph into low-dimensional Euclidean space so that most interactions are short-range. This embedding is relevant to many follow-on tasks, such as node reordering, clustering, and visualization. We focus on two spectral embedding algorithms customized to hypergraphs which recover linear and periodic structures respectively. We show that the two spectral hypergraph embedding algorithms are associated with a new class of generative hypergraph models. These models generate hyperedges according to node positions in the embedded space and encourage short-range connections. They allow us to quantify the relative presence of periodic and linear structures in the data through maximum likelihood. We demonstrate the hypergraph embedding and follow-on tasks -- including structure quantification, clustering and hyperedge prediction -- on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs. We find that the hypergraph approach can outperform clustering algorithms that use only dyadic edges. We also compare several triadic edge prediction methods on high school contact data where our algorithm improves upon benchmark methods when the amount of training data is limited.

 Gong, X, Higham, D.J. and Zygalakis, K, and Bianconi, G. Connection Hodge Laplacian for Directed Simplicial Complexes.

We define and analyze a new first-order Connection Hodge Laplacian for directed simplicial complexes, capturing directional flows on triangles. Through the analysis of triangle and torus examples, we showcase its ability to discover direction-related patterns.
