 Gong, X, Higham, D.J. and Zygalakis, K, and Bianconi, G. Connection Hodge Laplacian for Directed Simplicial Complexes.

We define and analyze a new first-order Connection Hodge Laplacian for directed simplicial complexes, capturing directional flows on triangles. Through the analysis of triangle and torus examples, we showcase its ability to discover direction-related patterns.
