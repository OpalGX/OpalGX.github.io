## [Large-area synthesis of monolayer and few-layer MoSe2 films on SiO2 substrates](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5000906) ##
Published in Nano Letters, 2009

We present successful synthesis of large area atomically thin MoSe2 films by selenization of MoO3 in a vapor transport chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system.
