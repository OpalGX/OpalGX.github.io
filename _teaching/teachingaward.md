I received the Edinburgh Teaching Award, which is equivalent to the [Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship) (AFHEA) . It provides national recognition of commitment to professionalism in teaching and learning in higher education in the UK.
